/*ðŸ”¹ Explanation
Two threads are created: t1 and t2.

obj1 does the "Cut Ticket" task.

obj2 does the "Show Chair" task.

Both threads run the run() method simultaneously.

Thread.sleep(2000) pauses the thread for 2 seconds.

While one thread is sleeping, the other can resume execution.

Thus, both threads run in parallel, showing true multithreading. */
